## Blackjack Tech Test - BBC SEGS 2022

This code is my first attempt at the tech test for the BBC Software Engineering Graduate Scheme, 2022.

While the game plays, and is fully functional, I decided to make a second version implementing a sort of 'Test Driven Development' approach. This was to make it easier for me to prove that my code satisfies the tests set by the BBC.

You can play the game by running `blackjack.py`.

### Requirements
Everything here should run with a 'vanilla' install of Python 3.x.
