## Blackjack Tech Test - BBC SEGS 2022

This code is my attempt at the tech test for the BBC Software Engineering Graduate Scheme, 2022.

It is **not yet finished**.

Run `blackjack.py` to give it a try.

The unit tests that will be in the /test directory, but have not been created yet (or, if they have been, do not work yet), can be run with the command `python3 -m unittest discover test`.

### Requirements
Everything here should run with a 'vanilla' install of Python 3.x.
